# Happiness is an overrated commodity

Happiness is mostly an overrated commodity these days but I'm not strictly anti-happiness. Just more like anti-happy people, because most of them are just so fake and full of illusion.

Genuinely happy people don't feel the need to advertise how happy they are.
